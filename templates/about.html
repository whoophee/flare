<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>You can parse/analyse your Dotah Tooh replays!</p>

<p>Source code available on <a href="">GitHub</a></p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>Beneath the covers, all of the heavy lifting is being done
  by <a href="">Dotabuff</a>'s open-source replay parser written in Go,
  called <a href="">Manta</a>.</p>
<p>Dota 2 is owned by Valve</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone!</p>
